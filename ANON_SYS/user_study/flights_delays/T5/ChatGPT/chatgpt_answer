show interesting properties of flights in the summer
(assuming summer months are June, July, and August)

import pandas as pd

# read the dataset

# filter for summer months
summer_df = df[(df['MONTH'] >= 6) & (df['MONTH'] <= 8)]

# calculate average departure delay for summer flights

# calculate the number of flights for each airline in the summer
airline_counts = summer_df['AIRLINE'].value_counts()
print("Number of flights for each airline in the summer:\n", airline_counts)

# calculate the percentage of delayed flights in the summer
delayed_flights = summer_df[summer_df['DEPARTURE_DELAY'] > 0]
delayed_percentage = (len(delayed_flights) / len(summer_df)) * 100
print("Percentage of delayed flights in the summer:", delayed_percentage)
