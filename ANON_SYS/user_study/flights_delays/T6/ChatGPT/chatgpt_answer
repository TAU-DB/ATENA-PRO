1. Importing necessary libraries and reading the dataset:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('flights.tsv', sep='\t')
```

2. Checking the dataset:

```python
df.head()
```

3. Checking the data types of columns:

```python
df.dtypes
```

4. Checking the number of missing values in each column:

```python
df.isnull().sum()
```

5. Checking the summary statistics of numeric columns:

```python
df.describe()
```

6. Exploring the reasons for flight delays:

```python
# Total number of delayed flights
total_delayed_flights = df[df['DEPARTURE_DELAY'] > 0]['DEPARTURE_DELAY'].count()

# Number of flights delayed due to air system delay
air_system_delayed_flights = df[df['AIR_SYSTEM_DELAY'] > 0]['AIR_SYSTEM_DELAY'].count()

# Number of flights delayed due to security delay
security_delayed_flights = df[df['SECURITY_DELAY'] > 0]['SECURITY_DELAY'].count()

# Number of flights delayed due to airline delay
airline_delayed_flights = df[df['AIRLINE_DELAY'] > 0]['AIRLINE_DELAY'].count()

# Number of flights delayed due to late aircraft delay
late_aircraft_delayed_flights = df[df['LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY'] > 0]['LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY'].count()

# Number of flights delayed due to weather delay
weather_delayed_flights = df[df['WEATHER_DELAY'] > 0]['WEATHER_DELAY'].count()

# Percentage of flights delayed due to different reasons
air_system_delay_percentage = (air_system_delayed_flights / total_delayed_flights) * 100
security_delay_percentage = (security_delayed_flights / total_delayed_flights) * 100
airline_delay_percentage = (airline_delayed_flights / total_delayed_flights) * 100
late_aircraft_delay_percentage = (late_aircraft_delayed_flights / total_delayed_flights) * 100
weather_delay_percentage = (weather_delayed_flights / total_delayed_flights) * 100

print("Total number of delayed flights:", total_delayed_flights)
print("Number of flights delayed due to air system delay:", air_system_delayed_flights)
print("Number of flights delayed due to security delay:", security_delayed_flights)
print("Number of flights delayed due to airline delay:", airline_delayed_flights)
print("Number of flights delayed due to late aircraft delay:", late_aircraft_delayed_flights)
print("Number of flights delayed due to weather delay:", weather_delayed_flights)
print("Percentage of flights delayed due to air system delay:", air_system_delay_percentage)
print("Percentage of flights delayed due to security delay:", security_delay_percentage)
print("Percentage of flights delayed due to airline delay:", airline_delay_percentage)
print("Percentage of flights delayed due to late aircraft delay:", late_aircraft_delay_percentage)
print("Percentage of flights delayed due to weather delay:", weather_delay_percentage)
```

This code will output the total number of delayed flights and the number of flights delayed due to different reasons along with their percentages.
