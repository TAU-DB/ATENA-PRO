One possible solution is to group the dataset by country and calculate the average duration of titles watched in each country. Then, we can compare the distribution of these averages to the overall distribution of durations. A country with a significantly different average duration may have atypical viewing habits.

Here's the code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('netflix.tsv', sep='\t')

# calculate the average duration of titles watched in each country
country_duration = df.groupby('country')['duration'].apply(lambda x: np.mean([int(d[:-4]) for d in x]))
country_duration = country_duration.dropna()  # remove countries with missing data

# calculate the overall distribution of durations
overall_duration = df['duration'].apply(lambda x: int(x[:-4]))
overall_mean = overall_duration.mean()
overall_std = overall_duration.std()

# compare the distribution of country averages to the overall distribution
z_scores = (country_duration - overall_mean) / overall_std
outliers = z_scores[abs(z_scores) > 2]  # consider countries with z-score > 2 as outliers

# print the outliers
print(outliers)
```

This code outputs a list of countries with significantly different average durations compared to the rest of the world. The threshold for considering a country as an outlier is set to z-score > 2, which corresponds to a p-value of 0.05 (assuming a normal distribution). However, this threshold can be adjusted depending on the desired level of significance.
