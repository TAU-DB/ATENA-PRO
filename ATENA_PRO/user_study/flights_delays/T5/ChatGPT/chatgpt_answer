Assuming that the 'month' column contains the month number (e.g. January = 1, February = 2, etc.), the following code can be used to show interesting properties of flights in the summer:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('flights.tsv', sep='\t')

# Filter for flights in the summer (June, July, August)
summer_flights = df[df['month'].isin([6, 7, 8])]

# Calculate the average departure delay for each airline
avg_delay_by_airline = summer_flights.groupby('airline')['departure_delay'].mean()

# Calculate the total number of flights for each airline
num_flights_by_airline = summer_flights['airline'].value_counts()

# Calculate the percentage of delayed flights for each airline
delayed_flights_by_airline = summer_flights[summer_flights['departure_delay'] > 0]['airline'].value_counts() / num_flights_by_airline

# Print the results
print("Average departure delay by airline in the summer:")
print(avg_delay_by_airline)
print("\nTotal number of flights by airline in the summer:")
print(num_flights_by_airline)
print("\nPercentage of delayed flights by airline in the summer:")
print(delayed_flights_by_airline)
```

This code first filters the dataset to only include flights in the summer (June, July, August). It then calculates three interesting properties for these flights:
