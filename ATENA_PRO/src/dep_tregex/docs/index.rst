``dep_tregex`` is a Python 2 module that implements
`Stanford Tregex <http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tregex.shtml>`_-inspired
language for rule-based dependency tree manipulation.

We also have visualization and basic unix-like utilities that work on
dependency trees in `CoNLL format <http://ilk.uvt.nl/conll/>`_: ``head``,
``wc``, ``shuf``, etc.
