# ATENA-PRO Benchamark
This repository contains the automatic benchmark used to evalute ATENA-PRO,  a framework for automatic discovery of personalized data stories, in the form of analytical
sessions. The repository is free for use for academic purposes. Upon using, please cite the paper:</br>

## The problem: Auto-generating meaningful, coherent EDA sessions.
Deriving and communicating meaningful insights from a given dataset requires data analysts and scientists to develop complex data-driven “stories”. This is often done by thoroughly exploring and investigating the data for contextually-related patterns, gradually building a narrative, then communicating the findings in a compelling medium such as an infographic, report, or a scientific notebook.

## The code:
ATENA-PRO benchmark as used in our experiments described in the paper

### [ATENA-PRO Benchmark](benchmark)
The benchmark, as used in our experiments, includes 3 datasets: lights, Netflix content and Google play store.
We additionally provide implementations for all of our evaluation metrics.
